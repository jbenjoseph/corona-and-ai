## Background

When we have no vaccine or therapeutic to treat a pandemic, the only tool we have to reduce the impact of a pandemic is slowing the transmission of the disease through the population. Many epidemics such as SARS and the many Ebola outbreaks were believed to be halted entirely though public health interventions to reduce and contain their spread. Even if the spread can not be stopped, effective isolation, testing, and tracing can have a major impact on the overall speed and infection rate of an epidemic until an effective therapeutic or vaccine can be found, reducing the cost on human life and suffering. In novel coronavirus, we saw that how well a jurisdiction does in epidemiological management had a profound effect on the spread of the disease.

If we can anticipate where a disease is spreading, a jurisdiction can establish non-pharmaceutical inventions (NPIs) to contain it. NPIs can include mandatory mask wearing, restricting mass gatherings, restricting the operation of restaurants and bars, and in especially dire situations a complete lockdown of a city or a country. The more local and surgical we can make our forecasting predictions, the less of an economic or societal impact our NPIs will have. But to be able to this, we must be able to model the spread and growth of the disease.

Epidemic forecasting and prediction may provide actionable and useful information for epidemic management and mitigation. However, the impact has been limited and stymied by poor data and slow scientific advancement. These forecasts are often published in research journals only once. If you were to compare a pandemic forecast to a weather report, the current state of affairs would be as if a meteorologist only predicted the weather once every few years. Researchers have spent some effort trying to improve the situation through benchmarking of specific sets of models, but there is no whole of field effort, possibly due to a lack of funding such an effort. Often they not reproducible at all, and due to the time consuming scientific publishing process are not available until after the pandemic's brunt effects have accumulated. Typically the data used is case counts and demographic information, sometimes weather and travel information is used.

Time series analysis is a special case of statistical analysis where variables or other objects in a feature vector are aligned on a temporal domain. As forecasting uses data that varies in time in a predictable manner, it is amiable to this kind of analysis. Examples of specific time series techniques that can be used in this problem include ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing. 

There is also a spatial component to forecasting. People near each other are more likely to get the disease. Thus models that work with spatial correlations like the convolutional neural network are useful with forecasting coronavirus.
